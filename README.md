1) extract.py
   - extract information from ML-lib docs
2) analyze_import.py 
   - extract keywords from import lines of the source code that use those ML-libs
   - loop through source code and extract lines containing those keywords


current status:
   - identified lines of code that use ML-libs

next steps: 
   - distinguish potential config options from irrelevant code in a most generic way
